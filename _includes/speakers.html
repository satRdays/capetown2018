The focus of his research is ecological modelling. He is an ecologist by training and self-taught in software development. He is applying an analytical approach referred to as Ecological Network Analysis (ENA) to understand complex estuarine functioning. This applies systems based thinking to delve into the problems associated with understanding these intricate ecosystems. After some preliminary research, he found that there was no robust, standardised methodology which would allow him to conduct his research. He therefore developed the R package being presented at this SatRday. He is using this methodology to produce various ecosystem models which will work towards providing ecologically sound information from potential data poor systems. His research provides crucial information on the status, structure and functioning of estuarine environments, allowing for ecosystem-based management decisions.">
