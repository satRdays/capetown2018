								<div class="session-abstract abstract">
								<p>The Nature Conservancy works to preserve marine ecosystems for the future. In November 2016, they asked data scientists to compete at building deep learning algorithms that can detect and classify species of fish from still images. We set out to compete in their competition, using R.</p>

								<p>In this session, we explore how to preprocess and prepare your data for deep learning. We then demonstrate how to use TensorFlow in R to build a solution to the challenge.</p>

								<div class="session-abstract abstract">
								<p>There are many options for data persistence from R; from SQL server to Mongo but one option that is fast, powerful, rich and very well suited to R programming  is Redis. The combination of data structures like queues, ordered lists, hash sets with a light in-memory footprint makes Redis the ideal choice for apps that have a high transaction rate, and many users.  In this tutorial, we will show how easy is it is to build R applications with Redis and in particular, how Shiny apps can share back end data through a Redis interface.</p>

							<li class="talk"> Quantitative Strategy Development & Evaluation in R (Jasen Mackie)
								<div class="session-abstract abstract">
								<p>R/quantstrat is an R package built by leaders in the R/Finance community allowing users to efficiently run backtests of trading strategies over multi-asset portfolios. I will run through a basic implementation of the package, and illustrate the tools available for evaluating backtest results, including the R/blotter package.</p>

								<p>For a basic idea of what some of the content will look like you can view Brian Peterson's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qBo0PqRObU">presentation</a> to the CapeRUser Group which I arranged in July this year. Slides are available <a href="http://braverock.com/brian/CapeR_2016_backtest.html#1">here</a>.</p>

								<p>Depending on the progress I make with the txnsim() R/blotter function by then, I may include it with my talk on evaluating the relative performance of the strategy versus its randomized equivalent with the objective being to assess skill versus luck or overfitting.</p>

							<li class="talk"> Visualizing the approach and exceedance of thresholds (Glenn Moncrieff) <i class="fa fa-flash lightning"></i> <a href="talks/satRday-2017-moncrieff.pdf"><i class="fa fa-download"></i></a>
								<div class="session-abstract abstract">
								<p>Visualizing thresholds is useful for understanding how they are approached and exceeded, and assisting in planning corrective action. Borrowing from applications in the environmental sciences that have been used to highlight threats to global ecological health, we show how the same technique can be applied to visualize the performance of currency traders.  Six trading rules are used to define thresholds for acceptable trader behaviour. Trading data are analyzed to produce reports aimed at encouraging poorly performing traders to undertake corrective behaviour. Radar plots for the visualization of thresholds are constructed using ggplot2 and the generation of reports with Rmarkdown is automated. A Shiny interface allows traders to easily view and download their personal report. This approach for comparing behaviour to predefined acceptable thresholds is applicable to a wider array of problems beyond trading behaviour or environmental sustainability.</p>

								<div class="session-abstract abstract">
								<p>Autonomous oceanographic sampling devices such as gliders, Argo floats and animal-borne instruments have become a major component of the ocean observing system and have proven invaluable to the ocean science community. Several steps are involved to get from the raw data to scientific products. While R is not well known or traditionally used in physical oceanography, there are packages and tools available well suited to this field. Seawater characteristics can be calculated from temperature and conductivity using available ocean science R packages such as ‘oce’ or ‘gsw'. ‘Oce’ can also be used to plot data density distribution maps. For subsequent analyses, statistical and geostatistical packages for R are helpful, e.g. kriging of variables for spatial interpolation using ‘gstat’. Packages such as ‘ggplot’ and ‘ggmap' are useful for the visualisation of data in the form of contour plots and current velocities.</p>

								<p>Here, we will showcase these uses of R for oceanography by highlighting results from two research studies where data from autonomous oceanographic sampling devices have been used. The successful use of autonomous devices can depend on the study region of interest. Therefore, we will first show results of a spatial and temporal comparison of data from Argo floats and animal-borne instruments in the Southern Ocean along with some functionality of the package ‘oce’. Second, a more in depth look at subsequent analysis of data will be shown, using data from gliders in the Agulhas current off Northern KwaZulu-Natal.</p>

							<li class="talk"> Impact of fishing on African penguin population off the West Coast (Andrea Ross-Gillespie) <i class="fa fa-flash lightning"></i> <a href="talks/satRday-2017-ross-gillespie.pdf"><i class="fa fa-download"></i></a>
								<div class="session-abstract abstract">
								<p>The African Penguin population has been declining steadily, likely as a result of dramatic changes in the anchovy and sardine abundances, as these species form the primary component of the penguins' diets. In 2008, an experiment was initiated  whereby an area of a 10nm radius around each of four selected breeding islands (Dassen and Robben islands on the West Coast, and Bird and St Croix on the South Coast) was closed to the fishery. The aim of the experiment is to see whether the fishing activity around the breeding island has a negative impact on the penguin population, or conversely whether closing the island to the fishery benefits the penguins in a meaningful way.</p>

								<p>Analysis of the collected penguin population data however did not yield conclusive results, leading to the question of whether or not the experiment should continue. The challenge is to balance (on the one hand) the risk of concluding that there is no meaningful impact on the penguin population when in fact there is an impact that has just not been detected yet in the data, and (on the other hand) continuing the closure experiment when there is in fact no meaningful beneficial impact on the penguin population, at a great cost to the fishing industry.  To address this challenge, we embarked on a form of a power analysis, which aims to answer the following question: If there is a biologically meaningful impact of the fishery on the penguin population, how long would the island closure experiment need to continue for before we are likely to detect this impact?</p>

								<p>This question, and the way to address it, has been the discussion of the International Stock Assessment Workshop held at UCT over the last two years. The work was concluded in December 2016, with the final recommendations by the panel for the workshop leading to the analyses presented at a recent working group meeting of the Fisheries Branch of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries to inform the decision on the future of the penguin island closure experiment.</p>

								<div class="session-abstract abstract">
								<p>More than half of the cells which make up our bodies are bacterial. The human body is home to a diverse array of bacteria and other microorganisms, collectively known as the human microbiome. Alterations in the microbiome have been linked to a wide variety of diseases including cancer, asthma, obesity, and depression.</p>

								<p>Over the last decade​, recent advances in DNA sequencing technology have​ facilitated rapid progress​​ in microbiome research, which has been met with the equally rapid ​development ​of​ data analysis methods - many of which are implemented in R.</p>

								<p>Here we briefly introduce R-based microbiome analysis, using the role of the microbiome in HIV susceptibility as an example. Creating graphics in R for high dimensional data serves as a first step in data exploration. As an example, we will demonstrate the use of annotated heatmaps, a versatile tool with a wide range of applications.</p>

								<div class="session-abstract abstract">

								<div class="session-abstract abstract">
								<p>We recently submitted an application to the World Health Organisation for the inclusion of a medicine (gabapentin) used to manage pain caused by nerve damage on its 'List of Essential Medicines'. Wanting to make the the process of generating the report as transparent and reproducible as possible, we decided to give R/RMarkdown a try. Using these tools, sprinkled with bits of LaTeX that had to learn on on the fly, we generated the full application, a supplementary <a href="http://painblogr.org/neuropathic-pain-storyboard-2016/">online storyboard</a>, and made all the code and data <a href="http://kamermanpr.github.io/WHO-EML-application-2016/">available online</a>. I will present some of the cool data on the burden of chronic pain (especially neuropathic pain) and analgesic medicine availability that we pulled together from various sources, and how we used R and some of the many static and interactive plotting tools available in the R ecosystem to analyse and visualise these data in a meaningful and (hopefully) compelling manner.</p>

								<div class="session-abstract abstract">
								<p>Trachoma is the worldwide leading infectious cause of blindness. Nearly 20 years ago, the World Health Organisation (WHO) issued the goal of eliminating trachoma induced blindness by the year 2020. Previous evidence has shown that targeted treatment to children less than 10 years of age is able to reduce prevalence across an entire community.</p>

								<p>A Markov model of trachoma transmission that assumes two age classes is presented, with parameters estimated using an accept/reject procedure fitted to data from a previous clinical trial. Based on the best fitting parameter sets, mass drug administration at different coverage and periodicity is simulated to assess its impact on population level prevalence.</p>

								<div class="session-abstract abstract">
								<p>The hominin (human) fossil record is scant, and palaeoanthropologists frequently rely on a variety of specialised programmes to make sense of our own evolution.

								<div class="session-abstract abstract">
								<p>This talk is an introduction to using spatial data in R, giving an overview as well as practical application of how spatial data can be created, manipulated and visualised using the R platform.It assumes no prior knowledge of spatial data analysis but prior understanding of the R command line would be beneficial. Practical applications will include: using the Google Elevation API with Google Maps Visualization using R, Spatial Interpolation/Modeling of Temperature Data in R and GIS climate change data on Amazon S3 using R.</p>

								<div class="session-abstract abstract">
								<p>StarCluster is an open source grid computing framework that was used with R and Shiny to produce a geospatial visual interactive dashboard to inform energy planners about the long term impact of climate change on energy supply in Africa.</p>

								<p>StarCluster runs on Amazon EC2 and allowed horizontal scaling of MIP optimization.  We were able to produce optimal energy solutions over thousands of future climate/socio-economic scenarios and decision.  These solutions are then presented to decision makers who can interact with the dashboard to build intuition, understand risks and discover opportunities.</p>

								<p>This talk is about using horizontal scaling to deal with uncertainty in decision making using R, Shiny and StarCluster on Amazon EC2.</p>

								<div class="session-abstract abstract">
								<p>We live in the Data Age and now have the ability to ingest huge quantities of information to power predictions and insights. A caveat to this new-found computational capacity is that the adage, <em>Garbage in, garbage out</em>, is still as relevant as ever, if not more so. In addition, the distillation of meaningful information from the Internet's data fire-hose takes careful processing and reduction; and a well-manicured dataset is worth its weight in gold.</p>

								<p>Fortunately, in tandem with this current rise in access to information, the open data movement is rapidly approaching maturation and governments / civic society are now providing powerful tools and insight-rich data repositories free-of-charge to whomever wants to utilize them. The inclusion of such sources and technologies in modern <em>Big Data</em> infrastructure can provide a powerful platform for impactful analyses.</p>

								<p>In this talk I will present the potential that these open data sources present for modern computational pipelines, and will discuss some successful applications of this paradigm to South African challenges.</p>
